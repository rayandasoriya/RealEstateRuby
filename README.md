</p>

The project is done using the concepts of Ruby on Rails for development. 

The purpose of this project is to design a portal for selling the properties. In the project, there are three access models: admin, realtor, and house hunter. House hunter is responsible for listing the details of the properties and replies to the inquiries of the house hunters. House hunter, on the other hand, can view the properties listed and can raise an inquiry. If they are interested in the property, then they can either contact the company directly or mark the company as interested.

We have also added the email feature with the replies to any inquiry and a Google login feature with only NC State email ids.

   - All users can use their **Google account** with NCSU email id to log into the system
